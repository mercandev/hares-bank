## What is Hares Bank? 🐇💸 

1. The purpose of this API is a fake bank API that I run simultaneously to be a good application on my way to learn swift.

2. Application uses PostgreSQL as DB. In addition, I installed the [Marten](https://martendb.io/) plugin for Document DB, which also uses PostgreSQL.

3. The application will additionally use the JWT infrastructure for security.

4. It will use Firebase for push notification (soon) and storage, auth. operations. (added)

5. ⚠️ Warning! This is just a scenario. Not suitable for real use! ⚠️
